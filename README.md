# Test for Java Developer
As a software engineer, I would like to implement microservices based backend APIs to register/edit/read/(soft) delete multiple users via ​ bulk operations
> Key requirements
  1. The applications should be written in spring-boot, Java or other JVM languages
  2. The applications will be packaged via docker and can run in a multi-container way via
      docker-compose.yml. Please provide details of how to run your application in a README file
  3. Upon successful registration, send out a welcome email (you could use fake smtp server)
  4. Proper validation, error handling and testing.
  5. Two ​ separate microservices​ user-service and notification-service
  6. Communication between services can either be synchronous or asynchronous
Additional Requirements
  1. REST API documentation (Compulsory for senior position application)
  2. Partial handling (Optional)

To run the app go to the main directory:<br>
$ spring-cloud-main/   <br> -- and execute the command<br>
$ ./local_env rebuild

All microservices should start up in a few minutes.

Eureka server should start on http://localhost:8761/ - here you can check if all services are running correctly.<br>
 - GATEWAY<br>
 - NOTIFICATION-SERVICE<br>
 - USER-SERVICE

To add a new user you should make a POST request to the endpoint <br>
(with the correct ipAddr - check it in eureka server) <br>
e.g. <br>
http://172.20.0.3:8085/user

with this Request body:

{<br>
         "email": "your email address",<br>
         "password": "fake_password",<br>
         "firstName": "fake_first_name",<br>
         "lastName": "fake_last_name"<br>
  }

After successfully registration, Notification-service should send welcome message for "your email address".
